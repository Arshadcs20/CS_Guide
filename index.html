        Computer Science (CS) is the study of the principles and use of
        computers. Simply put it's the science that deals with the theory and
        methods of processing information in digital computers, the design of
        computer hardware and software, and the applications of computers. A
        computer is simply a tool for a computer scientist, like a telescope for
        an astronomer.

      <h1 class="text-info my-5">Best Programming Languages to Learn</h1>
      <dl>
        <p>
          The following languages provide a reasonable mixture of paradigms and
          practical applications:
        </p>

        <dt>Javascript</dt>
        <dd>
          JavaScript is a good representative of the semantic model popular in
          dynamic, higher-order languages such as Python, Ruby and Perl.As the
          native language of the web, its pragmatic advantages are unique.
        </dd>
        <dt>Java</dt>
        <dd>
          The primary advantage of Java application development is that it is
          free and its syntax bears resemblance to various C-based programming
          languages, making it easier for developers to understand and
          implement.
        </dd>
        <dt>C</dt>
        <dd>
          If you want to be able to do more than write a simple web app, C is a
          great language. If you want to write a great, fast game, C is again a
          great choice. You can write an entire OS in C.
        </dd>
        <dt>C#</dt>
        <dd>
          C# AKA C Sharp, is a programming language that is designed for
          building a variety of applications that run on the .NET Framework. C#
          is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented.
        </dd>
        <dt>C++</dt>
        <dd>
          You can tap directly into the Windows API and work magic with it. You
          can program with objects and classes or abandon them altogether and
          make a C-style structured program.
        </dd>
        <dt>PHP</dt>
        <dd>
          PHP is a lot easier to get started with than you might think. By
          learning just a few simple functions, you are able to do a lot of
          things with your website. And once you know the basics, there are a
          wealth of scripts available on the
        </dd>
        internet that you only need to tweak a little to fit your needs.
        <dt>Haskell</dt>
        <dd>
          Haskell is the crown jewel of the Hindley-Milner family of languages.
          Fully exploiting laziness, Haskell comes closest to programming in
          pure mathematics of any major programming language.
        </dd>
        <dt>R</dt>
        <dd>
          R is a language and environment for statistical computing and
          graphics. It is similar to the S language and environment. R can be
          considered as a different implementation of S.
        </dd>
        <dt>Python</dt>
        <dd>
          It’s an easy language that just about anyone can master in a short
          period of time. If you’re impatient and want to make quick scripts
          that deliver results (and you don’t mind very rudimentary debugging),
          then you should definitely explore it! See also Python Programming
        </dd>
        <dt>SQL</dt>
        <dd>
          SQL is everywhere, and I'm not saying that because I want you to use
          it. It's just a fact. I bet you have some in your pocket right now.
          All Android Phones and iPhones have easy access to a SQL database
          called SQLite and many applications on your phone use it directly. It
          runs banks, hospitals, universities, governments, small businesses,
          large ones, just about every computer and every person on the planet
          eventually touches something running SQL. SQL is an incredibly
          successful and solid technology.

          insight: <br />All the information about any computable problem can be
          represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can
          flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as "on/off",
          "magnetized/de-magnetized", "high-voltage/low-voltage", etc.).

          insight:<br />
          There are only five actions that a computer has to perform in order to
          do "anything". Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a

              <b>Portfolio versus Resume</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A resume says nothing of a programmer's ability. Every
                  computer science major should build a portfolio. A portfolio
                  could be as simple as a personal blog, with a post for each
                  project or accomplishment. A better portfolio would include
                  per-project pages, and publicly browsable code (hosted perhaps
                  on github or Google code). Contributions to open source should
                  be linked and documented. A code portfolio allows employers to
                  directly judge ability. GPAs and resumes do not.
                </li>
                <br />
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Programming languages</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Programming languages rise and fall with the solar cycle. A
                  programmer's career should not. While it is important to teach
                  languages relevant to employers, it is equally important that
                  students learn how to teach themselves new languages. The best
                  way to learn how to learn programming languages is to learn
                  multiple programming languages and programming paradigms. The
                  difficulty of learning the nth language is half the difficulty
                  of the (n-1)th. Yet, to truly understand programming
                  languages, one must implement one. Ideally, every computer
                  science major would take a compilers class. At a minimum,
                  every computer science major should implement an interpreter.

            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Databases</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Databases are too common and too useful to ignore. It's useful
                  to understand the fundamental data structures and algorithms
                  that power a database engine, since programmers often enough
                  reimplement a database system within a larger software system.
                  Relational algebra and relational calculus stand out as
                  exceptional success stories in sub-Turing models of
                  computation. Unlike UML modeling, ER modeling seems to be a
                  reasonable mechanism for visualing encoding the design of and
                  constraints upon a software artifact.

            <li>
              <b>Discrete mathematics</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Students must have a solid grasp of formal logic and of proof.
                  Proof by algebraic manipulation and by natural deduction
                  engages the reasoning common to routine programming tasks.
                  Proof by induction engages the reasoning used in the
                  construction of recursive functions. Students must be fluent
                  in formal mathematical notation, and in reasoning rigorously
                  about the basic discrete structures: sets, tuples, sequences,
                  functions and power sets.

            <li>
              <b>Data structures and algorithms</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Students should certainly see the common (or rare yet
                  unreasonably effective) data structures and algorithms. But,
                  more important than knowing a specific algorithm or data
                  structure (which is usually easy enough to look up), students
                  must understand how to design algorithms (e.g., greedy,
                  dynamic strategies) and how to span the gap between an
                  algorithm in the ideal and the nitty-gritty of its
                  implementation.
                </li>
                <br />
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Theory</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A grasp of theory is a prerequisite to research in graduate
                  school. Theory is invaluable when it provides hard boundaries
                  on a problem (or when it provides a means of circumventing
                  what initially appear to be hard boundaries). Computational
                  complexity can legitimately claim to be one of the few truly
                  predictive theories in all of computer "science." A computer
                  student must know where the boundaries of tractability and
                  computability lie. To ignore these limits invites frustration
                  in the best case, and failure in the worst.

                <br />
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Architecture</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There is no substitute for a solid understanding of computer
                  architecture. Everyone should understand a computer from the
                  transistors up. The understanding of architecture should
                  encompass the standard levels of abstraction: transistors,
                  gates, adders, muxes, flip flops, ALUs, control units, caches
                  and RAM. An understanding of the GPU model of high-performance
                  computing will be important for the foreseeable future.
                </li>
                <br />
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Operating systems</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Any sufficiently large program eventually becomes an operating
                  system. As such, a person should be aware of how kernels
                  handle system calls, paging, scheduling, context-switching,
                  filesystems and internal resource management. A good
                  understanding of operating systems is secondary only to an
                  understanding of compilers and architecture for achieving
                  performance. Understanding operating systems (which I would
                  interpret liberally to include runtime systems) becomes
                  especially important when programming an embedded system
                  without one.
                </li>
                <br />
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Networking</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Given the ubiquity of networks, a person should have a firm
                  understanding of the network stack and routing protocols
                  within a network. The mechanics of building an efficient,
                  reliable transmission protocol (like TCP) on top of an
                  unreliable transmission protocol (like IP) should not be magic
                  to a computer guy. It should be core knowledge. People must
                  understand the trade-offs involved in protocol design--for
                  example, when to choose TCP and when to choose UDP.
                  (Programmers need to understand the larger social implications
                  for congestion should they use UDP at large scales as well.)
                </li>
                <br />
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Security</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The sad truth of security is that the majority of security
                  vulnerabilities come from sloppy programming. The sadder truth
                  is that many schools do a poor job of training programmers to
                  secure their code. Developers must be aware of the means by
                  which a program can be compromised. They need to develop a
                  sense of defensive programming--a mind for thinking about how
                  their own code might be attacked. Security is the kind of
                  training that is best distributed throughout the entire
                  curriculum: each discipline should warn students of its native
                  vulnerabilities.
                </li>
                <br />
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>User experience design (UX)</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Programmers too often write software for other programmers, or
                  worse, for themselves. User interface design (or more broadly,
                  user experience design) might be the most underappreciated
                  aspect of computer science. There's a misconception, even
                  among professors, that user experience is a "soft" skill that
                  can't be taught. In reality, modern user experience design is
                  anchored in empirically-wrought principles from human factors
                  engineering and industrial design. If nothing else, engineers
                  should know that interfaces need to make the ease of executing
                  any task proportional to the frequency of the task multiplied
                  by its importance. As a practicality, every programmer should
                  be comfortable with designing usable web interfaces in HTML,
                  CSS and JavaScript.

              <b>Software engineering</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The principles in software engineering change about as fast as
                  the programming languages do. A good, hands-on course in the
                  practice of team software construction provides a working
                  knowledge of the pitfalls inherent in the endeavor. It's been
                  recommended by several readers that students break up into
                  teams of three, with the role of leader rotating through three
                  different projects. Learning how to attack and maneuver
                  through a large existing codebase is a skill most programmers
                  will have to master, and it's one best learned in school
                  instead of on the job.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  If for no other reason than its outsized impact on the early
                  history of computing, student should study artificial
                  intelligence. While the original dream of intelligent machines
                  seems far off, artificial intelligence spurred a number of
                  practical fields, such as machine learning (I really like
                  machine learning), data mining and natural language
                  processing.
